## How the System Works

### 1. Data Storage

Data is stored in **CSV files** (easy to understand, no database needed):
- `customers.csv` → Customer information
- `accounts.csv` → Account details
- `transactions.csv` → All deposits/withdrawals
- `loans.csv` → Loan applications
- `loan_payments.csv` → EMI payment history
- ... and more

**When you run the app**:
1. App checks if CSV files exist
2. If not, creates empty files with headers
3. Loads data into memory (Pandas DataFrames)
4. After every operation, saves back to CSV

### 2. User Flow

```
Start App
  ↓
[Data Initialization & Loading]
  ↓
[Login Screen]
  ↓
[Main Menu with 6 Options]
  ├─→ Customer Management (5 operations)
  ├─→ Account Management (3 operations)
  ├─→ Transactions (5 operations)
  ├─→ Loan Management (4 operations)
  ├─→ Backup Data
  └─→ Exit
  
Each Operation:
  ├─ Input Validation (format, range checks)
  ├─ Business Logic (calculations, rules)
  ├─ Data Update (modify DataFrames)
  ├─ CSV Save (persist changes)
  └─ Confirmation (show results)
```

### 3. Transaction Example

```
Customer wants to transfer ₹1000 from ACC1001 to ACC1002

App does:
1. Validate both accounts exist
2. Check ACC1001 has ₹1000 + minimum balance
3. Deduct ₹1000 from ACC1001
4. Add ₹1000 to ACC1002
5. Create transfer record with ID, date, status
6. Create 2 transaction records (Debit & Credit)
7. Save all 3 DataFrames to CSV
8. Display confirmation with new balances
```

### 4. Loan EMI Example

```
Customer applies for ₹2,00,000 Personal Loan for 36 months

App calculates:
P = 2,00,000 (Principal)
R = 12.0% annual = 1.0% monthly = 0.01 monthly rate
N = 36 months

Using Formula: EMI = [P × R × (1+R)^N] / [(1+R)^N - 1]
Result: EMI = ₹6,644 per month

App displays:
- Loan ID: LOAN001
- Monthly EMI: ₹6,644
- Total amount to pay: ₹2,39,184
- Total interest: ₹39,184
- Status: Pending Approval
```

## Key Concepts Explained

### EMI (Equated Monthly Installment)
- Fixed monthly payment for a loan
- Includes both principal and interest
- Calculated using mathematical formula
- Same amount every month

### Interest Rate
- Annual percentage (e.g., 4% means ₹4 per ₹100 per year)
- Different for different products:
  - Savings: 4% p.a.
  - Personal Loan: 12% p.a.
  - Home Loan: 8.5% p.a.

### Minimum Balance
- Least amount you must keep in account
- Savings: ₹1,000
- Current: ₹5,000
- Cannot withdraw below this

### Outstanding Loan Amount
- Principal amount remaining (not yet paid)
- Decreases with each EMI payment
- When zero, loan is closed

### Daily Withdrawal Limit
- Maximum you can withdraw in one day: ₹50,000
- Prevents fraud and protects system
- Can apply for higher limit in person

---

## Important Limits & Rules

| Item | Value | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Min Balance (Savings) | ₹1,000 | Must maintain always |
| Min Balance (Current) | ₹5,000 | Must maintain always |
| Daily Withdraw Limit | ₹50,000 | Max per day |
| Large Transaction | ₹1,00,000+ | Flagged for review |
| Savings Interest | 4.0% p.a. | Credited monthly |
| FD Interest | 7.5% p.a. | On maturity |
| Loan Tenure | 12-240 months | Depends on type |

---

## Validation Rules

The system validates all inputs:

| Input | Rule |
|---|---|
| PAN | Exactly 10 chars: 5 letters + 4 digits + 1 letter |
| Aadhar | Exactly 12 digits |
| Phone | Exactly 10 digits |
| Email | Valid format with @ and . |
| Amount | Must be positive number |
| Date | Format YYYY-MM-DD |

**Invalid input is rejected** - User must enter again

## Real-World Workflow Example

### Day 1: Opening an Account

```
Customer: "I want to open a Savings Account"

Teller:
1. "What is your name?" → Customer: "Raghav"
2. "DOB?" → "2005-08-15"
3. "PAN?" → "ABCDE1234F"
4. "Aadhar?" → "123456789012"
5. "Phone?" → "9876543210"
6. "Email?" → "raghav@email.com"
7. "Initial deposit?" → "₹5000"

System:
- Creates CUST001
- Creates ACC1001
- Sets Balance = ₹5000
- Status = Active
- Saves to CSV

Teller: "Your account is ready! 
- Customer ID: CUST001
- Account Number: ACC1001
- Balance: ₹5000"
```

### Day 5: Earning Interest

```
System (automatic, behind the scenes):
- Reads Savings accounts from accounts.csv
- Calculates: 5000 × 4% ÷ 12 = ₹16.67
- Adds to balance: 5000 + 16.67 = ₹5016.67
- Updates accounts.csv
- Creates transaction record
```

### Day 10: Applying for Loan

```
Customer: "I want to borrow ₹2,00,000"

Teller:
1. "Customer ID?" → "CUST001"
2. "Loan type?" → "Personal Loan"
3. "How long?" → "36 months"

System:
- Calculates EMI = ₹6,644
- Creates LOAN001
- Status = Pending Approval
- Saves to loans.csv

Manager (next day):
- Views pending loans
- Approves LOAN001
- System adds ₹2,00,000 to ACC1001
- Status = Active
```

### Day 31: First EMI Payment

```
System (automatic):
- Reads LOAN001
- EMI = ₹6,644
- Checks ACC1001 balance
- Deducts ₹6,644
- Calculates: 5000 in principal, 1644 in interest
- Updates: Outstanding = ₹1,95,356
- Records payment in loan_payments.csv
- Creates transaction record
- Sends notification
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Customer not found"
**Solution**: Add customer first (Option 1 → 1)

### Issue: "Insufficient balance"
**Solution**: Check available balance; deposit money first

### Issue: "Invalid PAN format"
**Solution**: PAN must be 10 chars like ABCDE1234F

### Issue: Data not saving
**Solution**: Check if `data/` folder exists and is writable

### Issue: EMI calculation seems high
**Solution**: EMI includes interest; check with calculator
